# 1950WebsiteProposal
New website concept for COMP1950 at BCIT (Final Project)

### About
This repository consists of an index page (designed and built by my project partner Anitta Khuu) by which is a summary of what we set out to achieve in our redesign of the course page for COMP1950 at BCIT. In the "Proposal" link, you will find our mockup for the proposed site itself. This contains different layouts for the Home, Lecture, Quiz and Resource pages.
